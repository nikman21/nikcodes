subtitle: I hated programming. I hated computer science. I wanted nothing to do with computers. Now I am obsessed with it all.

I am currently about to graduate college at ASU with an Informatics degree! What is an informatics degree you may ask? To be honest, I am not entirely sure; I usually tell people it's a branch of computer science. For those of you who are really interested, here is the correct definition:

 >An informatics degree typically refers to a multidisciplinary field of study that combines elements of computer science, information technology, data analysis, and domain-specific knowledge to solve complex problems related to information management and technology.

I was a Computer Science student my Freshman year but realized that it was not for me. I did not enjoy programming. I contemplated with myself, fell into a little depression because I honestly did not know what I was going to do with my life. I felt like I was not smart enough to be a software engineer. I was discouraged by my school and wanted me to switch majors. A whole semester of pointless classes until I came to realization and said "fuck that, I want to be a software engineer" despite my doubts and other people's doubts. I switched to informatics, and I would say that was the best decision in my life.

One thing though, I still did not enjoy programming. The frustration I would go through with each homework assignment. Not to mention the little me on my shoulder telling me to stop making a fool out of myself. I would get tutors, watch videos, ask friends for help, and for some reason, it would just not make sense to me. This went on until my junior year of college. Junior year, I settled down; I realized I was not focused on programming. No, I was not an average engineering student; I liked to have fun. When I started college, my main focus was not school; it was partying and living it up! I cut a lot of corners to pass classes and did not take my studies seriously. It took me to my Junior year to finally realize why I am not understanding these concepts.

It wasn't that these concepts were too hard for me to understand (except some), but I was just not putting in the effort. So here is what I did and what I am continually doing:

1. **Code for atleast 2 hours a day**

2. **Stop watching tutorials instead research**
   - If you don't understand something, google it or youtube it.
   - Tutorials are not bad; watch them, build it, and then try doing it on your own after you watch it.

3. **Build something you will enjoy or that solves a problem**

4. **Never stop researching or learning**
    - Never think you know it all always learn there is so much new technologies that come out each year
    -You need to stay up to date or you will get left behind

5. **Leetcode**

Don't make the same mistakes I did. If I would have simply just paid attention in school and applied myself, I wouldn't have to self-teach myself and stress about this.

>I dedicate this to my beautiful girlfriend, Mya. She helped me find my passion and motivated me to continue this journey.

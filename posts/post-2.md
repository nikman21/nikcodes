subtitle: My thoughts on becoming a SWE and trying to get a job in this market
---

This market sucks! I recently graduated college and have been looking for entry-level software engineering roles at any company. I've been applying for jobs now for 3 months and have gotten nothing but rejection emails, one after another. I even tailored my resume to match what the company was looking for, and still, nothing. It's crazy that I went to college and haven't gotten a single interview. I knew it was going to be tough, but not this tough. My word of advice is not to give up. I know it's very discouraging getting rejection after rejection, but you are not alone. Tons of people are feeling like this and are experiencing this. My friend told me it took him about 5 months to even get a single interview! Now he's working at a good company. Good things take time, but eventually, we will get there. In the meantime, what I have been doing is getting more involved with the tech community, building projects (you never know, these projects could become startups if you work hard for it), grinding LeetCode, and keeping up with the latest technologies to sharpen my skills. I am positive if you do this on a consistent basis, you will eventually get where you want to be.

Happy grinding and stay positive!
